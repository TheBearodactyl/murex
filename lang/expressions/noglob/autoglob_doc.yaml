    `@g` (autoglob)

  Summary: >-
    Command prefix to expand globbing (deprecated)
  Description: |-
    **This feature is now deprecated and only applies to murex version 2:**

    By default Murex does not expand globbing (`*` and `?` wildcards) instead
    encouraging the use of `g` (and similar) inside a subshell. While the aim of
    this is to promote correctness, it can be a little annoying while working in
    the interactive shell. For this reason you can prefix any command with `@g` to
    enable Bash-like globbing.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    @g command ...
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    @g echo *
    ```
  Detail: |-
    As of Murex `2.9` and above it is possible to enable automatic globbing in
    the interactive shell without having to prefix the command with `@g` by
    enabling the following `config` option:

    ```
    config: set shell auto-glob true
    ```

    It is enabled by default on from version 3.x onwards (and renamed to
    `expand-glob`)
