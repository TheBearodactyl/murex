## Description

## Usage

```
key-code -> <stdout>
```

## Examples

```
Â» key-code
Press any key to print its escape constants...
```

...then press [f9] and `key-code` returns...

```
ANSI Constants:   {F9}
Byte Sequence:    %[27 91 50 48 126]

## Detail

### Redirection

If stdout is not a TTY then only the thing written is the ANSI Constant. This
is so that it can be used as a variable. eg

```
key-code -> set $key

event onKeyPress close=$key {
    exit
}
```
