# Reserved Variables

> Special variables reserved by Murex

In Murex, there are five different classes of variables:
1. Local variables (scope limited to a function et al)
2. Module variables (scoped to a module)
3. Global variables (available to every function within Murex but not shared
    with processes outside of the Murex's runtime)
4. Environmental variables (available to every function and process -- internal
    and external to Murex)
5. Reserved variables

Reserved variables are data that are available to any code running within
Murex and exposed as a variable.

Because reserved variables are dynamic properties of the runtime environment,
they can only be queried and not set:

```
Â» set SELF="foobar"
Error in `set` (0,1): cannot set a reserved variable: SELF
```
