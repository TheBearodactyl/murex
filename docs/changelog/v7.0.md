# v7.0

This change brings a number of ergonomic improvements to job control, `datetime` and working with structures.

## Deprecation Warnings

Please read out [compatibility commitment](https://murex.rocks/compatibility.html) to understand how features are deprecated.

* the `?` pipe will be deprecated to make way for a the ternary operator. You can achieve the same result with `<err> <!out>`, eg `command <err> <!out> parameters... | next-command ...`
  
* the `=` and `let` builtins are now officially deprecated. They've been marked as deprecated in the documentation for a couple of years but you'll now receive a deprecation warning when using them. This warning will not impact any functions that call them (they bypass the stdout and stderr pipes and write directly to your TTY) but it is still recommended that you update any existing code not to use it. The change is very simple, Murex supported expressions as first class primitives, so you can simply drop the `=` and `let` command names from your expressions

* `tread` has been deprecated for a while due to `read` supporting all `tread`'s use cases. `tread` will officially be removed in the next release

* `@[]` syntax for ranging has been deprecated for a while. It will be officially removed in the next release in favour of `[]`

* backtick strings (````) has been an undocumented hack for several years. This release officially sees that hack as deprecated and will be removed in the next release

* `die` has been deprecated because it just adds a feature for no purpose. It was original borrowed from Perl but realistically you can do the same with `exit 1` so this removal is to bring the language complexity down.
