# `MUREX_EXE` (path)

> Absolute path to running shell

## Description

`MUREX_EXE` is very similar to the `$SHELL` environmental variable in that it
holds the full path to the running shell. The reason for defining a reserved
variable is so that the shell path cannot be overridden.

This is a reserved variable so it cannot be changed.
