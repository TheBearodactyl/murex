# Meta Values (json)

> State information for iteration blocks

## Description

Meta Values, `$.`, provides state information for blocks like `foreach`,
`formap`, `while` and lambdas.

Meta Values are a specific to the block, so you will need to refer to each
iteration structure's documentation to check what information is exposed via
`$.`



## Examples

```
Â» %[Monday..Friday] -> foreach day { out "$.i: $day" }
1: Monday
2: Tuesday
3: Wednesday
4: Thursday
5: Friday
```
