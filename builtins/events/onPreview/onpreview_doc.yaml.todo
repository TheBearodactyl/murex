    `onPrompt`
  CategoryID: events
  Summary: >-
    Events triggered by changes in state of the interactive shell
  Description: |-
    `onPrompt` events are triggered by changes in state of the interactive shell
    (often referred to as _readline_). Those states are defined in the interrupts
    section below.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    event onPrompt name=(before|after|abort|eof) { code block }

    !event onPrompt name[.before|.after|.abort|.eof]
    ```
  Payload: |-
    The following payload is passed to the function via STDIN:

    ```
    {
        "Name": "",
        "Interrupt": {
            "Name": "",
            "Operation": "",
            "CmdLine": ""
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Name

    This is the **namespaced** name -- ie the name and operation.

    ### Interrupt/Name

    This is the name you specified when defining the event.

    ### Operation

    This is the interrupt you specified when defining the event.

    Valid interrupt operation values are specified below.

    ### CmdLine

    This is the commandline you typed in the prompt.

    Please note this is only populated if the interrupt is **after**.
  Flags:
    before: >-
      Triggered before readline displays the interactive prompt
    after: >-
      Triggered after user has written a command into the interactive prompt and then hit `enter`
    abort: >-
      Triggered if `ctrl`+`c` pressed while in the interactive prompt
    eof: >-
      Triggered if `ctrl`+`d` pressed while in the interactive prompt
  Examples: |-
    **Interrupt 'before':**

    ```
    event onPrompt example=before {
        out "This will appear before your command prompt"
    }
    ```

    **Interrupt 'after':**

    ```
    event onPrompt example=after {
        out "This will appear after you've hit [enter] on your command prompt"
        out "...but before the command executes"
    }
    ```

    **Echo the command line:**

    ```
    » event onPrompt echo=after { -> set event; out $event.Interrupt.CmdLine }
    » echo hello world
    echo hello world
    hello world
    ```
  Detail: |-
    ### Stdout

    Stdout is written to the terminal. So this can be used to provide multiple
    additional lines to the prompt since readline only supports one line for the
    prompt itself and three extra lines for the hint text.
  
    ### Order of execution

    Interrupts are run in alphabetical order. So an event named "alfa" would run
    before an event named "zulu". If you are writing multiple events and the order
    of execution matters, then you can prefix the names with a number, eg `10_jump`

    ### Namespacing

    The `onPrompt` event differs a little from other events when it comes to the
    namespacing of interrupts. Typically you cannot have multiple interrupts with
    the same name for an event. However with `onPrompt` their names are further 
    namespaced by the interrupt name. In layman's terms this means `example=before`
    wouldn't overwrite `example=after`.
    
    The reason for this namespacing is because, unlike other events, you might
    legitimately want the same name for different interrupts (eg a smart prompt
    that has elements triggered from different interrupts).
