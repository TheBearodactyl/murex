    Creates a QR code from STDIN
  Description: |-
    `qr` is an optional builtin which generates a PNG format image based on the
    input from STDIN. `qr` must be run as a method.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> qr -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ### Write PNG to disk

    ```
    » out "Hello, World!" -> qr |> qr.png
    ```

    ### Display PNG in terminal

    ```
    » out "Hello, World!" -> qr -> open-image
    ```
  Detail: |-
    `qr` sets stdout's data-type to be "image", which is defined in with the
    `open-image` optional builtin. So if you have that disabled then you may
    have to `cast` the output in some circumstances.
