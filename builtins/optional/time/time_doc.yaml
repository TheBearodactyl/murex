    Suspends the shell for a number of seconds
  Description: |-
    `sleep` is an optional builtin which suspends the shell for a defined number
    of seconds.
  Usage: |-

    sleep integer

  Detail: |-
    `sleep` is very simplistic - particularly when compared to its GNU coreutil
    (for example) counterpart. If you want to use the `sleep` binary on Linux
    or similar platforms then you will need to launch with the `exec` builtin:

    ```
    » exec sleep 5
    ```
