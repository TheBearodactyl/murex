    `%{}` Create object

    Quickly generate objects and maps
  Description: |-
    `%{}` is a way of defining objects in expressions and statements. Whenever an
    `%{}` object is outputted as a string, it will be converted to minified JSON.

    Object elements inside `%{}` can be new line and/or comma delimited. This
    allows for compatibility with JSON but without the pain of accidentally invalid
    comma management breaking JSON parsers. However a colon is still required to
    separate keys from values.

    Like with YAML, strings in `%[]` do not need to be quoted unless you need to
    force numeric or boolean looking values to be stored as strings.
  Examples: |-
    **Object passed as a JSON string:**

    ```
    » echo %{foo: bar}
    {"foo":"bar"}
    ```

    **The `%` prefix for the nested object is optional:**

    ```
    » %{foo: bar, baz: [1 2 3]}
    {
        "baz": [
            1,
            2,
            3
        ],
        "foo": "bar"
    }
    ```
