  Summary: >-
    Inlined commands for expressions and statements
  Description: |-
    The traditional way to spawn a sub-shell would be `${}` (or `$()` in Bourne
    Shell and its many derivatives). This works great for inlining entire command
    lines but it isn't so convenient if you want to call one command and
    particularly within an expression.

    This is where C-style functions can be more ergonomic. They follow the common
    structure of `command(parameters...)`. For example:

    ```
    » out("hello world")
    ```

    The syntax is not exactly like C and its derivatives however:

    * parameters are white space delimited, like with command line statements
    * strings do not need to be quoted, like with command line statements

    And unlike statements:

    * you cannot redirect stdout nor stderr
    * stdout is never a TTY. Even when it is ran directly in the terminal, it is
      still treated as a sub-shell

    Ostensibly, C-style functions are just syntactic sugar for `${}`. As such,
    they're not intended to be used liberally but rather just in instances it
    improves readability.

    ### Assignment In Expressions

    As a C-style function (CSF) vs a sub-shell:

    ```
    # CSF
    » $doc = open(README.md)

    # Sub-shell
    » $doc = ${open README.md}
    ```

    ### Numeric Value In Expressions

    As a C-style function (CSF) vs a sub-shell:

    ```
    # CSF
    » datetime(--in {now} --out {unix}) / 60
    28687556.3

    # Sub-shell
    » ${datetime --in {now} --out {unix}} / 60
    28687556.3
    ```

    ### Statement Inlining

    As a C-style function (CSF) vs a sub-shell:

    ```
    # CSF
    » echo It is datetime(--in {now} --out {py}%H) o\' clock
    It is 23 o' clock

    # Sub-shell
    » echo It is ${datetime --in {now} --out {py}%H} o\' clock
    It is 23 o' clock
    ```

    Notice in the example above, `echo`'s parameters are not quoted. This is
    because C-style functions do not support infixing.

    ### String Infixing

    C-style functions do not support being infixed like sub-shells can be:

    ```
    # CSF
    » echo "It is datetime(--in {now} --out {py}%H) o\' clock"
    It is datetime(--in {now} --out {py}%H) o' clock

    # Sub-shell
    » echo "It is ${datetime --in {now} --out {py}%H} o\' clock"
    It is 23 o' clock
    ```
