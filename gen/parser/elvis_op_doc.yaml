  Title: >-
    `?:` Elvis Operator
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Returns the right operand if the left operand is empty
  Description: |-
    The elvis operator is a little like a conditional where the result of the
    operation is the first non-empty value from left to right.

    An empty value is any of the following:
    
    * An unset / undefined variable
    * Any value with a `null` data type

    Other "falsy" values such as numerical values of `0`, boolean `false`, zero
    length strings and strings containing `"null"` are not considered empty by the
    elvis operator.
  Examples: |-
    **Assign a variable with a default value:**

    ```
    » $foo = $bar ?: "baz"
    ```

    If `$bar` is unset then the value of `$foo` will be **"baz"**.

    **Multiple elvis operators:**

    ```
    » $unset_variable ?: null ?: "foobar"
    foobar
    ```

    ### Whats in a name?

    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_operator) explains this best
    where it says:
    
    > The name "Elvis operator" refers to the fact that when its common notation,
    > ?:, is viewed sideways, it resembles an emoticon of Elvis Presley with his
    > signature hairstyle.
