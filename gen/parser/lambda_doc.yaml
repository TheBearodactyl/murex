    Iterate through structured data
  Description: |-
    Lambdas, in Murex, are a concise way of performing various actions against
    structured data. They're a convenience tool to range over arrays and objects,
    similar to `foreach` and `formap`.

    Code running inside a lambda inherit a special variable, named **meta values**,
    which hold the state for each iteration.
  Examples:

      {{ include "gen/includes/meta-values.inc.md" }}

      * `i`: iteration number (counts from one)
      * `k`: key name (for arrays / lists this will count from zero)
      * `v`: item value of map / object or array / list
