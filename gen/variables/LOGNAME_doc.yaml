    `LOGNAME` (str)
  CategoryID: variables

  Summary: >-
    Username for the current session (historic)
  Description: |-
    `LOGNAME` returns the user name of the current Murex session. It's behaviour is
    identical to `USER`.

    > `LOGNAME` is a historical relic. Please use `USER` in your scripts instead.

    ### USER vs LOGNAME

    The `$USER` and `$LOGNAME` environment variables serve similar but slightly
    different purposes. Plus and their distinctions stem from historical and
    compatibility reasons.

    1. Historical Context:

       * `$LOGNAME` originates from early AT&T UNIX systems and was intended to
         hold the userâ€™s login name, particularly for system utilities that relied
         on it.
         
         It has been part of POSIX since early UNIX specifications, which is why it
         is a required variable in POSIX-compliant systems.

       * `$USER` came from BSD UNIX and was commonly used by shells and more user-
         focused applications. This variable has been adopted widely in modern
         systems like Linux to refer to the current user within shell scripts and
         interactive environments.

    2. Functional Difference:

       Both variables typically hold the same value, representing the current
       user's login name. However, in certain contexts in POSIX environments,
       (such as running `sudo` from Bash), their behavior may differ:
         
       * `$LOGNAME` is more tightly bound to the user who originally logged in,

       * while `$USER` may be altered during a session.

       **With regards to Murex, both variables call the same underlying function
       and thus will always return the same values under all circumstances.**
      
    3. Why Two Variables?:

       * In POSIX shells like Bash, the existence of both `$LOGNAME` and `$USER`
         reflects the integration of features from both AT&T UNIX and BSD UNIX.
         Although they usually return the same value, POSIX mandates `$LOGNAME`
         for broader system compatibility, especially with utilities that depend
         on login information.

       * However with Murex, there isn't any requirement to maintain POSIX
         compatibility with AT&T UNIX. What's more, neither of these two variables
         are defined as environmental variables.

         The reason Murex retains supports for `$LOGNAME` as a reserved variable is
         simply to ensure nobody accidentally uses `$LOGNAME` for any other
         purposes (such as logging) and then get confused why other utilities might
         break after they've overwritten the contents of `$LOGNAME`
