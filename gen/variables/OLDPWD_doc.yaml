    same data is via `$PWDHIST`.

    ### Comparison With PWDHIST

    `PWDHIST` is an array that holds the entire `PWD` history rather than just the
    previously accessed path.

    `OLDPWD` reads `PWDHIST`, so if `PWDHIST` is overwritten, this will affect the
    value of `OLDPWD` as well.

    ### Error Handling

    If a previous directory cannot be determined, then `OLDPWD` will error. For
    example:

    ```
    Â» cd $OLDPWD
    Error in `cd` (0,1): cannot assign value to $OLDPWD: already at oldest entry in $PWDHIST
                       > Expression: cd $OLDPWD
                       >           :          ^
                       > Character : 9
    ```
