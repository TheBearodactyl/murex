    ### Deprecation of `ARGS`

    In Murex versions 4.x and below, this variable was named `ARGS` (with an 'S').
    However in Murex 5.x and above it was renamed to `ARGV` (with a 'V') to unify
    the name with other languages.

    `ARGS` will remain available for compatibility reasons but is considered
    deprecated and may be removed from future releases.
