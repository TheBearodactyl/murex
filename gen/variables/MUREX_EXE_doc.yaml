    `MUREX_EXE` (path)
  CategoryID: variables
  Summary: >-
    Absolute path to running shell
  Description: |-
    `MUREX_EXE` is very similar to the `$SHELL` environmental variable in that it
    holds the full path to the running shell. The reason for defining a reserved
    variable is so that the shell path cannot be overridden.

    This is a reserved variable so it cannot be changed.
