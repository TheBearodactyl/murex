    Path of current shell
  Description: |-
    `SHELL` is an environmental variable containing the full path to the current
    shell -- which in our case is Murex.

    This variable is set by Murex to conform to POSIX standards. However, being an
    environmental variable, it can be overwritten via `export`.
    
    For Murex specific code, you are recommended to use `MUREX_EXE`, which is a
    reserved variable, and thus read only, if you require precision and safety.
