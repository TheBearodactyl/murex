    ## Description

    `man` page parsing is used extensively throughout Murex. From providing default
    autocompletions through to quick access of those manuals via the `[f1]` preview
    pane.

    This document describes the various different integrations around those `man`
    pages.

    > Please note that this is only supported on Linux, macOS, BSD and other
    > UNIX-like platforms. Windows and Plan 9 do not currently support these
    > specific integrations.

    ## Autocomplete

    Autocomplete, sometimes referred to as "tab-completion", are command and
    parameter suggestions offered when you press `[tab]`.

    A lot of commands will have a bespoke {{link "autocomplete config" "autocomplete"}}
    defined for them. However writing autocomplete rules for every command out
    there would be hugely time consuming and impractical. Thus **Murex can
    automatically generate autocompletions** based on the contents of a commands
    `man` page.

    ## Preview

    If you want to quickly read a `man` page without disrupting your flow in the
    command line, then you can press `[f1]` to preview it.
    
    This preview will allow you to keep typing out your command line while also
    presenting the `man` page in an easy to read layout.

    ## Summary

    When you type a command in, you will see a brief description of what that
    command is, in your {{bookmark "hint text" "interactive-shell" "hint-text"}}.
    That command will generally be pulled from its accompanying `man` page.
