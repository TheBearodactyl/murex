    ## Description

    From `direnv`'s [Github README](https://github.com/direnv/direnv):

    > `direnv` is an extension for your shell. It augments existing shells with a
    > new feature that can load and unload environment variables depending on the
    > current directory.

    While this functionality isn't built into the core of Murex, `direnv` has
    added their own hook to support Murex.
    
    More details can be found on their [hook.md](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/docs/hook.md#murex)
    document.
