    ## Description

    `Makefiles` can sometimes be hard to grok. So Murex provides out-of-the-box
    support to make working with `make` a little easier.

    ## Autocompletions

    Custom {{link "autocomplete" "autocomplete"}} rules exist for `make` which will
    not only include any `make` specific flags, but also include any parameters
    defined in your `Makefile` too.

    ## Preview

    If you press `[f1]` with your command as `make`, and you have a `Makefile` in
    your current working directory, then you will be presented with a preview of
    your `Makefile`.
    
    ## Source Code
   
    The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/blob/master/integrations/make_posix.mx)
    under `/integrations`.
