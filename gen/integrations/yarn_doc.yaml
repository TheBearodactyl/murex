    ## Description

    `yarn` is a common tool for working with `package.json`. Some developers use
    this almost like a `Makefile`.

    Murex comes with some handy autocompletions out-of-the-box for working with
    `yarn` in the command line.

    ## Autocompletions

    Custom {{link "autocomplete" "autocomplete"}} rules exist for `yarn` which will
    not only include any `yarn` specific flags, but also include any parameters
    defined in your `package.json` too.
