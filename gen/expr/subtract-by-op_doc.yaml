    `-=` Subtract By Operator
  SubCategoryIDs: [ parser.assignment ]
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Subtracts a variable by the right hand value (expression)
  Description: |-
    The Subtract By operator takes the value of the variable specified on the left
    side of the operator and subtracts it by the value on the right hand side. Then
    it assigns the result back to the variable specified on the left side.

    It is ostensibly just shorthand for `$i = $i - value`.

    This operator is only available in expressions.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » $i = 3
    » $i -= 2
    » $i
    1
    ```
