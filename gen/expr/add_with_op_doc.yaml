    `+=` Add With Operator
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Adds the right hand value to a variable (expression)
  Description: |-
    The Add With operator takes the value of the variable specified on the left
    side of the operator and adds it with the value on the right hand side. Then
    it assigns the result back to the variable specified on the left side.

    It is ostensibly just shorthand for `$i = $i + value`.

    This operator is only available in expressions.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » $i = 3
    » $i += 2
    » $i
    5
    ```
