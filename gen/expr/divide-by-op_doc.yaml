  Title: >-
    `/=` Divide By Operator
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Divides a variable by the right hand value (expression)
  Description: |-
    The Divide By operator takes the value of the variable specified on the left
    side of the operator and divides it by the value on the right hand side. Then
    it assigns the result back to the variable specified on the left side.

    It is ostensibly just shorthand for `$i = $i / value`.

    This operator is only available in expressions.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » $i = 3
    » $i /= 2
    » $i
    1.5
    ```
