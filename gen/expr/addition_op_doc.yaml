    `+` Addition Operator (expr)
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Adds two numeric values together
  Description: |-
    The Addition Operator adds two numeric values together in an expression. Those
    values are placed either side of the addition operator.
  Examples: |-
    #### Expression

    ```
    » 3+2
    5
    ```

    #### Statement

    ```
    out (3+2)
    » 5
    ```
  Detail: |-
    Unlike in some other programming languages, the `+` operator cannot be used to
    concatenate strings. This is because shells are historically untyped so you
    cannot always guarantee that numeric-looking value isn't a string. To solve
    this problem, by default Murex assumes anything that looks like a number is a
    number when performing addition. Thus overloading the `+` operator to
    concatenate strings would lead to a large class of bugs.

    ```
    » str = "3"
    » int = 2
    » $str + $int
    5
    ```

    For occasions when type safety is more important than the convenience of silent
    data casting, you can disable the above behaviour via `config`:

    ```
    » config set proc strict-types false
    » $str + $int
    Error in `expr` (0,1): cannot Add with string types
                        > Expression: $str + $int
                        >           : ^
                        > Character : 1
                        > Symbol    : Scalar
                        > Value     : '$str'
    ```
