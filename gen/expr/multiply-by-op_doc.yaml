    `*=` Multiply By Operator
  SubCategoryIDs: [ parser.assignment ]
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Multiplies a variable by the right hand value (expression)
  Description: |-
    The Multiply By operator takes the value of the variable specified on the left
    side of the operator and multiplies it with the value on the right hand side
    Then it assigns the result back to the variable specified on the left side.

    It is ostensibly just shorthand for `$i = $i * value`.

    This operator is only available in expressions.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » $i = 3
    » $i *= 2
    » $i
    5
    ```
