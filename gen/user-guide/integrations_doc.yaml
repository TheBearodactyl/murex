    ## Description

    Murex is highly customisable, as every good shell should be. However the Murex
    community believe that extendability and support for customisations are no
    substitute for good defaults.

    Murex aims to provide you with the best support for your wider command line
    needs, in its "out-of-the-box" configuration.

    So with that goal in mind, the following configurations come pre-installed with
    Murex's base install.
