    features:
      - title: Content Aware
        icon: arrows-to-circle
        details: |-
          Murex has built-in support for natively manipulating various file formats such as JSON, TOML, YAML, CSV, and commonlog. This allows for seamless integration and manipulation of data in various formats.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Data types can be explicitly cast and reformatted, but also inferred if preferred.</b>
        link: types/

      - title: Expressions
        icon: check-double
        details: |-
          Murex treats variables as expressions, allowing you to perform calculations and evaluations directly within the shell. This feature helps to avoid accidental bugs caused by spaces or incorrect syntax, providing a more reliable and predictable scripting experience.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Never worry about file names with weird characters, nor running equations in "bc" again.</b>
        link: parser/

      - title: Smartly Interactive
        icon: wand-magic-sparkles
        details: |-
          Murex parses man pages for command line flags and provides smart autocomplete functionality. By pressing the TAB key, you can auto-complete commands and parameters, and "fzf"-like functionality baked in.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Navigating the command line is faster, more intuitive and efficient than ever before.</b>
        link: user-guide/interactive-shell

      - title: Easily Extended
        icon: cubes
        details: |-
          Murex has an extension framework that allows you to design your own modules or enjoy prebuilt extensions. This allows for customization and additional functionality. The built-in package manager makes it very easy to share your configuration, import other peoples modules, and port your set up between different machines.

Murex is a shell, like bash / zsh / fish / etc however Murex supports improved
features and an enhanced UX.

A non-exhaustive list features would include:

* Support for **additional type information in pipelines**, which can be used
  for complex data formats like JSON or tables. Meaning all of your existing
  UNIX tools to work more intelligently and without any additional configuration.

* **Usability improvements** such as in-line spell checking, context sensitive
  hint text that details a commands behavior before you hit return, and
  auto-parsing man pages for auto-completions on commands that don't have auto-
  completions already defined.
  
* **Smarter handling of errors** and **debugging tools**. For example try/catch
  blocks, line numbers included in error messages, stdout highlighted in red
  and script testing and debugging frameworks baked into the language itself.

## Language Guides

* Read the [language tour](/docs/tour.md) to get started.

* The [Rosetta Stone](/docs/user-guide/rosetta-stone.md) is a
great cheatsheet for those wishing to skip the tutorials and jump straight in.
This guide includes comparisons with Bash.

* The [Interactive Shell](/docs/user-guide/interactive-shell.md)
guide walks you through using Murex as a command line as opposed to a scripting
language.

usability. [Read more](compatibility.md)
