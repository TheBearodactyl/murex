    features:
      - title: Content Aware
        icon: arrows-to-circle
        details: |-
          Murex has built-in support for natively manipulating various file formats such as JSON, TOML, YAML, CSV, and commonlog. This allows for seamless integration and manipulation of data in various formats.

          Data types can be explicitly cast and reformatted, but also inferred if preferred.

      - title: Expressions
        icon: check-double
        details: |-
          Murex treats variables as expressions, allowing you to perform calculations and evaluations directly within the shell. This feature helps to avoid accidental bugs caused by spaces or incorrect syntax, providing a more reliable and predictable scripting experience.
          <br/><br/>
          Never worry about file names with weird characters, nor running equations in "bc" again.

      - title: Smartly Interactive
        icon: wand-magic-sparkles
        details: |-
          Murex parses man pages for command line flags and provides smart autocomplete functionality. By pressing the TAB key, you can auto-complete commands and parameters, and "fzf"-like functionality baked in.
        
          Navigating the command line navigation faster, more intuitive and efficient than ever before.

      - title: Easily Extended
        icon: cubes
        details: |-
          Murex has an extension framework that allows you to design your own modules or enjoy prebuilt extensions. This allows for customization and additional functionality.

          The built-in package manager makes it very easy to share your configuration, import other peoples modules, and port your set up between different machines.

Murex is a shell, like bash / zsh / fish / etc however Murex supports improved
features and an enhanced UX.

A non-exhaustive list features would include:

* Support for **additional type information in pipelines**, which can be used
  for complex data formats like JSON or tables. Meaning all of your existing
  UNIX tools to work more intelligently and without any additional configuration.

* **Usability improvements** such as in-line spell checking, context sensitive
  hint text that details a commands behavior before you hit return, and
  auto-parsing man pages for auto-completions on commands that don't have auto-
  completions already defined.
  
* **Smarter handling of errors** and **debugging tools**. For example try/catch
  blocks, line numbers included in error messages, STDOUT highlighted in red
  and script testing and debugging frameworks baked into the language itself.

## Examples

**JSON wrangling:**

**Inline spellchecking:**

**Autocomplete descriptions, process IDs accompanied by process names:**

## Language Guides

* Read the [language tour](https://murex.rocks/tour.html) to get started.

* The [Rosetta Stone](https://murex.rocks/user-guide/rosetta-stone.html) is a
great cheatsheet for those wishing to skip the tutorials and jump straight in.
This guide includes comparisons with Bash.

* Lastly the [Interactive Shell](https://murex.rocks/user-guide/interactive-shell.html)
guide walks you through using Murex as a command line $SHELL as opposed to a
scripting language.

## Install instructions

See [INSTALL](https://murex.rocks/INSTALL.html) for details.

## Discuss Murex

Discussions presently happen in [Github discussions](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/discussions).

## Compatibility Commitment

Murex is committed to backwards compatibility. While we do want to continue to
grow and improve the shell, this will not come at the expense of long term
usability. [Read more](compatibility.md)

## Known bugs / TODO

Murex is considered stable, however if you do run into problems then please
raise them on the project's issue tracker: [https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues)
