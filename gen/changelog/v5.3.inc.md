## Deprecation Warnings

Please read out [compatibility commitment](https://murex.rocks/compatibility.html) to understand how features are deprecated.

* the `?` pipe will be deprecated to make way for a the ternary operator. You can achieve the same result with `<err> <!out>`, eg `command <err> <!out> parameters... | next-command ...`
  
## Features

* persistent cache added using sqlite3 backend. This cache is optional however it is enabled by default. You can disable it by placing the following into your `.murex_profile`:
  ```
  config set shell cache.db-enabled false
  ```

* new `autocomplete` directive for `[f1]` previews: `DynamicPreview`

* dynamic previews added for `git` and `aws`

* bugfix: structures in variables would sometimes output base64 encoded values when converting those structures to arrays ([issue #768](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/768))
